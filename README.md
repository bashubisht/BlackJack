## BlackJack

# Game Overview
In this Blackjack game, the goal is to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. If your hand goes over 21, it's a "bust," and you lose. You play against the dealer, and to win, your hand must have a higher value than the dealer's hand.

# Card Values
Number cards have a value equal to their number.
Picture cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 10.
Aces are worth 1.

# How to Play
1. Hit Button:
When you click the "Hit" button, a new card is drawn for you. You can continue hitting to draw as many cards as you want.

2. Stand Button:
When you're satisfied with your hand, click the "Stand" button. This will end your turn, and the dealer will start drawing cards.

3. Dealer's Hand:
If the dealer's hand exceeds your hand, you lose the game.
